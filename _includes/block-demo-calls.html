&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/wwwmoviemakingfr">www.moviemaking.fr</a> - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it8fAZ9QmXk">hytexx demo call</a></p>
<p>Well since we usually don't have any interesting news (beause I delete them soon after haha), I thought may be we could use this space for s.th. more useful this time. Not sure if we are going to do more of these demo calls or not (probably not), but in case you have a serious demo call too, <a href="http://advancedfx.style-productions.net/forum/">let us know</a>.</p>
<p>In case you aren't scared by the video above already, we also got some kind of <a href="/media/">media section</a> (not sure why though, may be for scaring kids and their parents - or most likely for wasting your precious time).</p>
